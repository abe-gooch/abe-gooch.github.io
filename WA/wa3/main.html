            <p>I’m a Creative Technology and Design student at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I plan to apply what I’ve learned to design and integrate technology into the mundane pockets of the world. 
            I’ve developed a variety of skills and abilities to aid that goal, including critical attention to detail, strong communication, and a tendency to dive head-first into new domains of knowledge. My portfolio serves as a snapshot into my education, passions, and aspirations.
