    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <div>
        <p>I'm interested in designing immersive spaces that inspire learning and exploration in people of all ages. I also love all things music, and can't go a day without it. I enjoy gaming and hanging out with my brother, and exploring new places. The last movie I watched was Madagascar 3, with the crazy French lady.</p>

    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <div>
        <p>I'm aiming to attend a masters program in Edinburgh, Scotland for Museum Heritage and Exhibition. While finishing my degree here at CU I intend to learn more about how people think, how to design a space, and take a whole bunch of project-based classes.</p>
